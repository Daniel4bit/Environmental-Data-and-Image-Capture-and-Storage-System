# Environmental-Data-and-Image-Capture-and-Storage-System

A system using ESP32CAM, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensors, HX710B pressure sensor, and a 5V 1A power supply to capture environmental data and images. The system will integrate with Google Sheets for data logging and Google Drive for image storage, providing real-time monitoring and historical analysis capabilities.

## Project Objectives:
● Capture temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity data every minute.
● Capture a color image every minute and store it in Google Drive.
● Provide a user-friendly interface for WiFi setup and configuration.
● Deliver a reliable and robust system within a 4-week timeline.

## Components:
● ESP32CAM(Camera Module 2MP, 1600x1200 pixels)
● DHT11 Sensor
● HX710B Pressure Sensor
● 5V 1A Power Supply
